# The Ajah Libraries #

##  Background ##

The Ajah libraries are a set of utility libraries that are intended to address common programming needs (e.g. ajah-util), streamline other APIs (e.g. ajah-servlet), and provide common functionality (e.g. ajah-user).

##  Building ##
This repository is set up as a suite of Maven projects.  The dependencies they use vary from few to many, so you may want to import them into your IDE on an as-needed basis.

##  Status & Completion ##
In the interest of only solving problems that exist, these libraries are largely built on an as-needed basis.  This may lead to some "missing" code that you might expect to be there, which basically means you're solving a problem I haven't encountered yet.  I'm happy to review pull requests for such things.

## Versioning ##
This project has not adopted any versioning strategy.  If you plan to use this code, do not expect backwards compatibility, so please make sure you're prepared to refactor and test if you decide to upgrade.  Forking the project and upgrading at your own pace is highly recommended.

For more information, see the README in each project.

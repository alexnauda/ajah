/**
The Ajah User Library provides user and account functionality.  The generic terminology demands some clarification:

<ul>
<li><em>Users</em> are individual people who can access the system.
<li><em>Accounts</em> are billing/management entities.
</ul>

A user may belong to zero or more accounts, and an account may have one or more users.
